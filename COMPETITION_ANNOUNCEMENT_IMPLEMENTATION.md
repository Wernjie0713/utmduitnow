# Competition Announcement Modal Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a force modal system to inform users about the competition data cleanup (removal of pre-November 1, 2025 transactions) due to a programming error. The modal requires acknowledgment before users can continue using the platform.

## Implementation Date
November 1, 2025

## Features

### 1. Database Tracking
- Added `has_seen_competition_announcement` boolean field to users table
- Tracks whether each user has seen and acknowledged the announcement
- Defaults to `false` for all users

### 2. Smart Display Logic
The modal is shown only to users who:
- Have NOT seen the announcement yet (`has_seen_competition_announcement = false`)
- Created their account on or before November 1, 2025 (affected by data cleanup)
- New users after Nov 1 don't see this modal (they weren't affected)

### 3. Force Modal (Cannot Dismiss)
- Users MUST acknowledge the modal to continue
- Cannot close by clicking outside or pressing ESC
- No close button in the modal
- Must click "I Understand - Continue to Competition" button
- Only shown after Google OAuth profile completion modal (if applicable)

## Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_11_01_050926_add_has_seen_competition_announcement_to_users_table.php`

Adds boolean field to track announcement acknowledgment:
```php
$table->boolean('has_seen_competition_announcement')->default(false);
```

### 2. Artisan Command
**File**: `app/Console/Commands/CleanPreCompetitionTransactions.php`

Command to remove all transactions dated before Nov 1, 2025:
```bash
# Preview what will be deleted
php artisan competition:clean-pre-competition-data

# Force delete without confirmation
php artisan competition:clean-pre-competition-data --force
```

Features:
- Shows summary by status (approved, pending, rejected)
- Lists affected users count
- Deletes associated receipt images from storage
- Uses database transactions for safety
- Requires confirmation (unless --force flag)
- Progress bar for deletion
- Beautiful console output

### 3. Modal Component
**File**: `resources/js/Components/CompetitionAnnouncementModal.jsx`

React component with:
- Beautiful, professional UI design
- Clear explanation of the issue (programming error)
- Detailed competition period information:
  - Week 1: Nov 1-9, 2025 (9 days)
  - Week 2+: Monday-Sunday (7 days)
  - Competition ends: Dec 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM
- Important reminders section
- Force acknowledgment button
- Loading state during acknowledgment
- Cannot be dismissed without clicking button

## Files Modified

### 1. User Model
**File**: `app/Models/User.php`

Added field to fillable array:
```php
protected $fillable = [
    // ... existing fields
    'has_seen_competition_announcement',
];
```

### 2. Dashboard Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`

Added methods:
- `shouldShowCompetitionAnnouncement($user)` - Determines if modal should show
- `acknowledgeAnnouncement(Request $request)` - Marks announcement as seen

Logic:
```php
// Only show to users created on or before Nov 1, 2025
$announcementCutoffDate = Carbon::parse('2025-11-01 23:59:59', 'Asia/Kuala_Lumpur');
return $user->created_at->lte($announcementCutoffDate) && !$user->has_seen_competition_announcement;
```

### 3. Profile Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`

Added same `shouldShowCompetitionAnnouncement()` method to show modal on profile edit page.

### 4. Routes
**File**: `routes/web.php`

Added route for acknowledgment:
```php
Route::post('/competition/acknowledge-announcement', [DashboardController::class, 'acknowledgeAnnouncement'])
    ->name('competition.acknowledge-announcement');
```

### 5. Dashboard Page
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard.jsx`

Integrated modal:
```jsx
<CompetitionAnnouncementModal 
    show={showCompetitionAnnouncement}
/>
```

### 6. Profile Edit Page
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Profile/Edit.jsx`

Integrated modal (shown only if Welcome Modal is not visible):
```jsx
<CompetitionAnnouncementModal 
    show={showCompetitionAnnouncement && !showWelcomeModal}
/>
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Clean Pre-Competition Data**
   ```bash
   php artisan competition:clean-pre-competition-data
   ```

3. **Build Frontend Assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Clear Caches**
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

5. **Verify**
   - Login as an existing user
   - Confirm modal appears
   - Acknowledge modal
   - Verify it doesn't appear again

## Database Schema Change

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN has_seen_competition_announcement BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE 
AFTER email_verified_at;
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /competition/acknowledge-announcement
**Purpose**: Mark that user has seen the announcement

**Auth**: Required

**Request**: Empty body

**Response**:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Announcement acknowledged"
}
```

**Effect**: Sets `has_seen_competition_announcement = true` for current user

## Future Considerations

- The modal logic can be reused for future important announcements
- The database field can be renamed/repurposed for other announcements
- The display logic checks the cutoff date (Nov 1, 2025) - this is hardcoded
- If you need similar announcements in the future, consider:
  - Making the cutoff date configurable
  - Adding an announcement_version field for multiple announcements
  - Creating an announcements table for dynamic content

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Remove Modal from UI**
   ```bash
   # Comment out modal in Dashboard.jsx and Edit.jsx
   # Rebuild assets
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Rollback Migration**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
   ```

3. **Restore Data** (if deleted)
   - Restore from database backup before running cleanup command
   - No automated rollback for deleted transactions
