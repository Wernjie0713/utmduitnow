# Competition End Date Implementation

## Summary
Added logic to reject all receipt submissions after the competition ends on **December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM** (Malaysia Time).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `app/Helpers/CompetitionWeekHelper.php`

#### Added Constants
```php
const COMPETITION_END_DATE = '2025-12-28 23:59:59';
```

#### New Methods

**`hasCompetitionEnded(?Carbon $date = null): bool`**
- Checks if the competition has ended
- Returns `true` if current date/time is after Dec 28, 2025 11:59 PM
- Used to prevent any new submissions after competition ends

**`isWithinCompetitionPeriod(Carbon $date): bool`**
- Checks if a transaction date is within the competition period
- Returns `true` if date is between Nov 1, 2025 and Dec 28, 2025
- Used to reject receipts dated after the competition end date

**`getCompetitionEndDateString(): string`**
- Returns formatted end date: "December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM"
- Used in user-facing error messages

### 2. Updated `app/Services/TransactionVerificationService.php`

#### Enhanced `validateTransactionDate()` Method

Added two new validation checks:

**Check 1: Competition Has Ended**
```php
if (\App\Helpers\CompetitionWeekHelper::hasCompetitionEnded()) {
    return [
        'valid' => false,
        'reason' => 'The competition has ended on December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM. No more receipts can be submitted.'
    ];
}
```
- Blocks ALL submissions after competition ends
- User-friendly error message with exact end date

**Check 2: Receipt Date After Competition**
```php
if (!\App\Helpers\CompetitionWeekHelper::isWithinCompetitionPeriod($transactionDate)) {
    return [
        'valid' => false,
        'reason' => 'Only receipts dated before December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM are accepted. The competition has ended.'
    ];
}
```
- Validates that the transaction date on the receipt is within competition period
- Prevents users from submitting receipts dated after Dec 28, 2025

### 3. Updated Documentation

Updated `COMPETITION_WEEK_LOGIC.md` with:
- Competition end date information
- New validation rules (scenarios 5 & 6)
- Testing scenarios for end date validation
- Examples for new helper methods

## Validation Flow

The transaction date validation now follows this order:

1. ✅ Check if date is in the future → Reject
2. ✅ **Check if competition has ended** → Reject
3. ✅ **Check if transaction date is within competition period** → Reject if after Dec 28
4. ✅ Check if competition has started → Reject if before Nov 1
5. ✅ Check if transaction is from current competition week → Reject if not current week

## Error Messages

### After Competition Ends
When trying to submit ANY receipt after Dec 28, 2025 11:59 PM:
> "The competition has ended on December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM. No more receipts can be submitted."

### Receipt Dated After Competition
When submitting a receipt with a date after Dec 28, 2025:
> "Only receipts dated before December 28, 2025 at 11:59 PM are accepted. The competition has ended."

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Last Valid Submission
- **Submission Time**: Dec 28, 2025 at 23:59:59
- **Receipt Date**: Dec 28, 2025
- **Result**: ✅ Accepted

### Scenario 2: First Invalid Submission Time
- **Submission Time**: Dec 29, 2025 at 00:00:00
- **Receipt Date**: Dec 28, 2025
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - "Competition has ended"

### Scenario 3: Receipt Dated After Competition
- **Submission Time**: Dec 15, 2025 (during competition)
- **Receipt Date**: Dec 29, 2025
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - "Receipt date after competition end"

### Scenario 4: Late Week Receipt During Competition
- **Submission Time**: Dec 1, 2025

2. `app/Services/TransactionVerificationService.php` - Enhanced date validation logic
3. `COMPETITION_WEEK_LOGIC.md` - Updated documentation with end date information

## No Breaking Changes
